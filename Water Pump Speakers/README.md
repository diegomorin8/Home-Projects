# Water Pump Speakers
## Description
Development of a set of Speakers that will pump a water stream depending on the music frequency. This is a project that was developed as part of the course in Applied Electronics at te "Escuela Superior de Ingenieros Industriales, UPM". 

Both the electronics and structural designed were designed and built from scratch. For the electronics, several amplifying circuits were used along with frequency filters. 

The structure was designed using SolidEdge and printed in my home-made 3D printer.
